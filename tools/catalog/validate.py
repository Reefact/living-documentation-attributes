"""Validates the pattern catalog.

    python3 tools/catalog/validate.py

The single source of truth shared by whoever edits the catalog and by CI, so the
two can never disagree about what a valid entry is. It checks each entry against
`catalog/pattern.schema.json`, and then three rules a JSON schema cannot state on
its own:

* every name in a role's `links` is a role of the same pattern;
* role names are unique within a pattern;
* `specialisationOf` points at an entry that exists in the SAME catalogue, and a
  declension never derives from a work published later than its own — the
  anteriority that decides which side holds the definition (ADR-0006);
* a `specialisationOf` that names a role names one the target actually has, on a
  target that is not flat, and no role of the narrowing reaches further than the
  role it narrows (ADR-0034).

Exit status: 0 when every entry is valid, 1 otherwise.
